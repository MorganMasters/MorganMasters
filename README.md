### A rising specialist in deep learning, applied mathematics, and the solution of data-driven problems. 

I am a PhD student at the University of California at Santa Cruz, focused on field robotics in single-agent, multi-agent, or heterogeneous robotic teams and human-in-the-loop control/planning. Previously, I worked at at the Applied Physics Laboratory of the University of Washington, developing deep-learning-based vision solutions for applications in robotics. This work has included the assembly of a novel dataset and the development of a novel deep-learning architecture to deliver robotics control decisions.

I am broadly interested in the mathematics behind the development of these methods, and aim to sharpen the cutting edge with insightful application of theory and well-formed code. I enjoy being a part of larger teams working on novel tech development in robotics and perception or on data-driven infrastructure improvements, both digital and logistical.
